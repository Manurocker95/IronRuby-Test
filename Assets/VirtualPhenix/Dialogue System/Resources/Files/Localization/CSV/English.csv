TutorialText,"Tap con the cells to discover a coin card for 2 coins each. You need to discover all the 2 and 3! Coconuts cards explode and it's game over. If you clear the board you win the earned coins!<br><br>In every column and row you can find the number of coconuts in the row or column (Big Number) and the number of coins in that row or column (small numbers).<br><br>Example: 5 cells, 2 bombs and 3 coins = 3 coins for 3 cells (5 cells - 2 bombs) = 1, 1, 1. No 2 or 3.<br><br>Check the columns and rows to see where and where not it is possible to have a 2 or 3."
